                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p> In short, the challenge of this project was to conceptualize and design a lightweight remote
                    controlled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that satisfied a set of predefined design conditions. The
                    two goals of which were:
                <ul>
                    <li>to design a set of aerodynamic surfaces for an existing propulsion and fuselage system</li>
                    <li>the performance goal is to provide the aircraft with the maximum speed range</li>
                </ul>
                <figure>
                    <img src="fixedwing_imgs/Fuselage_System.jpg" alt="" class="width80">
                    <figcaption>Existing fuselage system</figcaption>
                </figure>
                In addition to being an intensive design activity, the project had a large focus on teamwork, delegation
                of tasks, and proper design process documenting.</p>

                <h1>Aerodynamic Calculations</h1>
                <p>Designing the aircraft vaguely fell into 3 categories: electronics & avionics, aerodynamic analysis,
                    and structural and material analysis.</p>

                <p>The section I chose to lead was the aerodynamic analysis as it was where I could best apply my
                    knowledge of Python and flight mechanics, but still have a part in the physical design of the
                    aircraft.</p>

                <p>The eventual flight tests the aircraft would undergo (the performance of which would determine the
                    score the aircraft received) were as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>High speed flight</li>
                    <li>Stall and low speed flight</li>
                </ol>
                Keeping these in mind and at the top of the priority list in terms of ideal design, an initial
                conceptualization of the aircraft wing cold be made.</p>

                <figcaption>Constraint plots from left to right: Coefficient of Drag to Velocity; Coefficient of Lift to
                    Velocity; CL vs CD</figcaption>

                <p>The constraint plots above show the very first analyses that were done to find ranges for the
                    allowable coefficients of drag and lift. These were based off of some specified aircraft values,
                    such as mass (1.5kg) and wing span (1.8m).</p>


                <p>From these plots, a minimum desired flight velocity was selected, and from there, a desired minimum
                    CL... and from there, we could begin selecting our airfoil shape. This was done in part by narrowing
                    down the search results from a large database of airfoils using the information we calculated from
                    the plots. In addition to that, we tried to identify the airfoils with the highest lift-to-drag
                    ratios, greatest thicknesses (to maximize manufacturing feasibility), and have the highest stall
                    angle possible. This would allow the aircraft to fly efficiently at low speeds; one of the two
                    design goals. We realized early on, from provided engine thrust data, that we would effectively
                    never be limited by available engine power. In other words, electric motors have such a high power
                    to weight ratios nowadays that a relatively small RC plane will not produce enough drag to actually
                    slow down the plane. Armed with this assumption, we decided to focus on low-speed performance. </p>

                </div>

                <p>This lead to the selection of the Wortmann FX 60-126.</p>

                <h1>Conceptual Design</h1>
                <p>The next aerodynamic challenge was to improve lift distribution. This is done by approximating an
                    elliptical wing distribution (most famously seen in the WWII Spitfire). Due to manufacturing
                    constraints, building a double-curvature wing out of foam would not have been possible given the
                    equipment we had available to us. So our approximation was to be done by adding a semi-taper to the
                    wing. We briefly looked into adding twist as well, but the additional manufacturing complication
                    simply meant it was not worth it. </p>

                    <figcaption>Schematic of the proposed semi-taper dimensions</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>I conducted this analysis using a python script that would iterate through every possible semi-taper
                    starting position (labelled as a in the above diagram). The tip chord (C_tip) also had to be taken
                    into consideration, as values below (what we decided) 10cm would be too small to manufacture and/or
                    sustain useful loads. This factor would become especially important later on in the structural
                    integrity testing phase. </p>

                    <img src="fixedwing_imgs/TaperLift.png" alt="" class="width50">
                    <figcaption>To better visualize what's going on, the plot on the left shows (in orange) what an
                        ideal lift distribution looks like on a wing. In blue, is the lift distribution of a wing with a
                        continues taper from root to tip. If the wing were a constant chord (i.e. just a rectangle) the
                        distribution would also be constant (ignoring wing tip vortex effects etc.)</figcaption>
                </figure>

                    <figcaption>An excerpt of the code used to iterate through the taper start positions.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>Above is part of the code that was used to determine the best possible lift distribution given a
                    linear semi-taper. The script iterated through all a positions and calculated an area of the curve.
                    If it was not within 0.001m2 of ideal elliptical area (16.235m2) it was rejected.</p>

                <p>Finally, the semi-tapers that resulted in a close approximation of the ideal lift distribution area
                    were plotted on the graph (right) above - in addition to certain manufacturing constraints. This
                    created a range to choose from; the final decision was a compromise between an aerodynamic ideal and
                    manufacturability. </p>

                    <figcaption>As a side note: this plot was the predicted lift distribution for a wing with twist.
                        Although it clearly approximated the ideal more closely, creating a smooth rotation would have
                        been infeasible at this scale, and seriously compromised the structural integrity of the wing.

                </figure>

                <p>With all major design decision relating to the aerodynamics of the wing having been made, we started
                    making CAD models of our design. </p>

                <h1>Manufacturing and Final Calculations</h1>
                <p>Shortly after, using the material analysis completed by another team member, we started manufacturing
                    prototypes of the wing sections to conduct preliminary structural tests. </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="fixedwing_imgs/Prototype1.jpg" alt="" class="width80">
                    <figcaption>First prototype of wing</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>It was at this point that we realized twist would have been very difficult to implement, and the idea
                    was abandoned completely. </p>
                <p>The final aerodynamic calculation that I had to complete at this stage was the aileron moment
                    calculations, in other words, how big the ailerons had to be to successfully roll the aircraft. </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="fixedwing_imgs/AileronCalc.png" alt="" class="width80">
                </figure>
                <p>The time needed to roll 30 degrees was calculated to be 1.6 seconds, at the approach speed (the
                    slowest speed the aircraft should have to fly at in normal conditions). This value was judged to be
                    acceptable. </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="fixedwing_imgs/WingCAD4.png" alt="" class="width80">
                </figure>
                <p>After some more revisions to the CAD, we include finer details such as how the spar would integrate
                    into the structure, where the wiring would pass through, where servos would mount to, and how the
                    three sections of the wing would connect together. </p>

                <h1>Assembly</h1>
                <p>Finally we started assembling the wing:</p>

                </figure>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="fixedwing_imgs/build1.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%">
                    </div>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>The final step was to wrap the wing in heat-shrink Mylar to protect it from rain and to ensure as
                    smooth an airflow as possible.</p>

                <h1>Flight Day</h1>
                <p>The day finally came to test the aircraft in flight. The stakes were high as we only had one chance
                    to try it, and we were not allowed to test it prior to this day. So... we were extremely happy when
                    our plane flew perfectly; an enormous satisfaction after months of work.</p>
