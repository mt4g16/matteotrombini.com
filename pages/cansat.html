            </div>

            <div class="page_content_cansat">
                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p> The American Astronautical Society has been running an annual space-engineering competition open to
                    university students for many years, and now sees competitors fly to Dallas from all over the world
                    to participate.</p>

                <p>The competition has a full design-build-launch structure to it, which gives participating teams
                    experience in bringing a complex engineering project to fruition and be involved with all stages of
                    the end-to-end life cycle.</p>

                <p>Each year, slightly different design goals are prescribed. In general however, the main task is to
                    develop a payload (the "satellite") that gets placed into a rocket, is deployed, and eventually
                    recovered when it lands. The 2019 competition had the following mission objectives:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The CanSat shall consist of two parts, the science payload and the container to protect the
                        science payload as it is deployed from the rocket.</li>
                    <li>The Cansat shall be launched to an altitude ranging 670 - 725m above the launch site and
                        deployed near apogee (peak altitude).</li>
                    <li>The CanSat container must protect the science payload from damage during the launch and
                        deployment.</li>
                    <li>The CanSat shall descend using a parachute at a descent rate of 20 m/s.</li>
                    <li>At 450 meters, the container shall release a science autogyro payload de-accelerating to 10 to
                        15 m/s.</li>
                    <li>As the science payload descends under autogyro control, the payload will transmit telemetry
                        which shall include sensors to track altitude using air pressure, external temperature, battery
                        voltage, GPS position, pitch and roll and autogyro blade spin rate sensors.</li>
                    <li>When the science payload lands, all telemetry transmission shall stop and a locator audio beacon
                        shall activate.</li>
                </ul>

                <figure>
                    <img src="cansat_imgs/Operations1.png" alt="" class="width80">
                    <figcaption>An overview of the system operation</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>Bonus Objective</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A video camera shall point downward 45 degrees from nadir. It shall be spin stabilized and point
                        in one direction relative to the earth’s magnetic field with a stability of +/- 10 degrees.</li>
                    <li>Video shall be in colour with a minimum resolution of 640x480 pixels and 30 frames per second.
                    </li>
                    <li>The direction the camera is pointed relative to earth’s magnetic north shall be included in the
                        telemetry. </li>
                </ul>

                <p>2019's competition was particularly challenging as it involved learning about a new concept none of
                    us were particularly familiar with prior to this competition: an autogyro. What is effectively an
                    aircraft with freely rotating un-powered blades that rotate only by the effects of the slipstream.
                    Quite different from a conventional helicopter, that relies on an engine. </p>

                <p>In addition to the mission objective, there were many additional constraints. Some of the more
                    important and complicating ones are listed below:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Total mass of 500 grams +/- 10 grams </li>
                    <li>CanSat shall fit in a cylindrical envelope of 125 mm diameter x 310 mm length</li>
                    <li>The descent rate of the CanSat (container and science payload) shall be 20 meters/second +/-
                        5m/s.</li>
                    <li>The container shall release the payload at 450 meters +/- 10 meters.</li>
                    <li>All descent control device attachment components shall survive 30 Gs of shock.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Conceptual Design</h1>
                <p>As the mechanical design team lead, my job began immediately as other design decision relied heavily
                    on the eventual design my team would settle on. We started brainstorming several conceptual designs,
                    and eventually narrowed them down to two system-level concepts:</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="cansat_imgs/Concept1.png" alt="" class="width80">
                    <figcaption>Concept 1</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <ul>
                    <li>Spring actuated clamshell container opening</li>
                    <li>Servo actuated three ring mechanism to maintain stowed configuration</li>
                    <li>Two large blades</li>
                    <li>Exposed areas of payload and container covered by Mylar</li>
                </ul>

                <figure>
                    <img src="cansat_imgs/Concept2.png" alt="" class="width80">
                    <figcaption>Concept 2</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <ul>
                    <li>Released by cutting nylon chord with nichrome wire</li>
                    <li>Four blades</li>
                    <li>Blades deployed by use of springs</li>
                    <li>Payload and container covered by Mylar</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In the end, we decided to go with the second conceptual design as it was the most reliable in terms
                    of release mechanism , the easiest to manufacture, and generally the simplest design.</p>

                <p>With a relatively concrete idea of what shape the final container and payload would take, we were
                    able to start dimensioning it. This is a crucial stage, as whether the systems all integrate
                    properly depend largely on whether or not they wee properly accounted for at this point in the
                    design cycle.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="cansat_imgs/Dimensions.png" alt="" class="width80">
                    <figcaption></figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The next design challenge was settling on the payload design. This too went through many conceptual
                    prototyping stages, but eventually two main approaches emerged.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="cansat_imgs/Payload1.png" alt="" class="width80">
                    <figcaption>Configuration 1: Two-blade system</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <figure>
                    <img src="cansat_imgs/Payload2.png" alt="" class="width80">
                    <figcaption>Configuration 2: Four-blade system</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>As mentioned above, we settled on the second concept. This payload (that gets ejected from the
                    container at 450 metres) had the following components on board (numbered on the diagram):</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Two springs</li>
                    <li>Hinge</li>
                    <li>Attachments points</li>
                    <li>Optical sensor</li>
                    <li>Batteries in battery compartments</li>
                    <li>PCB</li>
                    <li>Raspberry Pi Zero</li>
                    <li>Camera</li>
                    <li>Servo with Fins</li>
                </ol>

                <h1>Prototyping and Build</h1>
                <p>The final design ended up evolving quite a bit throughout the manufacturing process as we realized
                    what we could and couldn't do in terms of material availability (and cost) and manufacturing
                    feasibility.</p>

                    <figcaption>First laser cut sections of the container section</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>Thanks to the detailed CAD that was produced in the design phase, prototyping was relatively
                    straightforward, although each individual component had to have minor adjustments made to them, and
                    went through several iterations.</p>

                <p>The container went through the biggest (still minor) design alteration, where the entire top of it
                    that would house the electronics was redesigned so as to have an easier access hatch. </p>

                <p>The rotor (that held the blades) was by far the most complex system on the CanSat, it was composed of
                    5 components, each 3D printed to a very high tolerance. It functioned by having torsion springs
                    constantly pushing against the blades when in the stowed configuration, and when the payload would
                    drop out of the container, the springs would force the blades to open.</p>

                <p>Upon our arrival in Texas, we had 2 days to get our CanSat approved through various structural and
                    drop tests. Once that was complete, and after making a few final adjustments, we headed to the field
                    where we set up our Ground Station and loaded our CanSat into the rocket. </p>
